// The same tool, served by three surfaces, must not have three vocabularies.
//
//   TARGET_URL=http://localhost:3000 node scripts/test-projection-parity.js
//
// WHY: /api/find, /api/route and /api/index/tools all return tool rows. They
// disagreed on field names, and a missing key is indistinguishable from a
// missing value:
//
//   price      served by /api/find and /api/route, absent from /api/index/tools
//   priceUsd   served by /api/index/tools and /api/route, absent from /api/find
//   slug       absent from /api/index/tools, the surface listing 65k rows
//   payable    added to /api/route only, and to nothing else, on the same day
//              as a fix for this exact class of defect
//
// This is the failure mode src/x402-index.js's own header calls out: a field
// present on some accessors and not others is inert on whichever surface
// happens to be read. It was measured wrong twice during one audit because
// reading `price` off /api/index/tools returned undefined for every row and
// looked like "nothing is priced".
//
// A parity test is the only thing that catches it, because each surface is
// individually correct.
